      "raw": "\nExtend UI is a versatile library of reusable components, thoughtfully designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building modern web applications. Our components are based on the widely adopted <b>shadcn/ui</b> library but go beyond it by introducing enhanced styling capabilities, new component variants, and entirely new elements. Whether you're a beginner looking to kickstart a project or an experienced developer seeking to optimize workflows, Extend UI offers the flexibility and customization to fit your needs.\n\n## Purpose\n\nOur core vision is to create a comprehensive library that empowers developers to craft web applications faster and with greater ease. We set out with a mission: to provide an extensive and well-organized collection of components that are flexible, intuitive, and easy to edit, while maintaining the best practices established by <b>shadcn/ui</b>.\n\nBy offering a wide range of pre-built, customizable components, we aim to eliminate much of the repetitive work developers face, allowing them to focus more on building unique, feature-rich applications. Our components are built with reusability and scalability in mind, making it easy to adapt them to various use cases, whether for a small personal project or a large enterprise application.\n\nMoreover, our library doesn't stop at just the basic building blocks. We’ve created multiple variants of each component, giving developers more options to tailor the design and functionality to their specific project requirements. These variants open the door to even more creativity, enabling developers to fine-tune the appearance, interactions, and behavior of each component with ease.\n\n## Extending Functionality\n\nIn addition to the core components and their variants, we would like to offer a wide selection of templates and larger component groups that can serve as the foundation for more complex applications. These templates will provide a head start for developers by combining multiple components into cohesive, pre-built layouts, significantly reducing the time and effort required to create fully-featured pages and sections. This modularity will allows for an efficient and scalable development process, where individual components can be used independently or in combination to build more sophisticated structures.\n\nOur vision is to ensure that <b>Extend UI</b> becomes a one-stop solution for developers seeking speed, flexibility, and ease in their workflow. We are continuously expanding our component base, driven by user feedback and the evolving needs of the developer community.\n\n## Who Is It For?\n\nWhether you're building a personal blog, a startup's landing page, or a large-scale enterprise web application, Extend UI is designed with all levels of expertise in mind. New developers will find our library easy to navigate, with well-documented components that can be quickly implemented. Experienced developers will appreciate the depth of customization, the modular structure, and the time saved by leveraging ready-to-use, high-quality components.\n\nIn essence, <b>Extend UI</b> is more than just a component library—it’s a toolset for enhancing productivity and creativity, helping developers of all skill levels create modern web applications faster, more efficiently, and with greater flexibility.\n",
